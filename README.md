Early prototype.

Meanwhile check out this Pd library and build:  
https://github.com/uliss/pure-data

Key concepts / roadmap for this project:
-----------------------------

   - Separate UI 'client' and 'server' parts of the application.  
   For now the app is built as 'pd-server' and the gui (tilde~) itself. Later it is supposed to have the possibility to split these parts over the network, to have no-gui option etc.
   - Separate UI classes for client side with simple communication with puredata objects
   - MVC architecture for 'client' app
   - Simplified UI object set without duplicate features (i.e. combining the number atom and number2). Unified property system for all objects
   - Pd Vanilla patch compatibility (import, limited export)
   - GUI features on 'client' side:
      * Grid/object alignment 
      * Zoom
      * Text search 
      * Unified object properties handling 
      * extended undo / clipboard operation, patchcord connection options
   - embedded Python.  
   'Client' - based python api includes:
      * creating/deleting/editing objects/patchcords/properties
      * UI extensions api - adding toolbars-menus etc
      * Python modules - use Qt, OpenGL, numPy, OFx, etc
      * UI script object 
      runs scripts on 'client' side and has inlets/outlets to connect to its puredata patch.
